    <p></p>
    In week two, we did the Artist Lab. I made 2 stars with my code.
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img src="Scratch.png" height="300" width="500">
    <p></p>
    In week 3, We made a game in scratch. I made a pong style game where it was impossible to win. <p></p>
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img src="App_game.PNG" height="500" width="300">
    <p></p>
    In week 4, we made a game and app for a "phone". I made an animal app where the sound is made when you click on the
    image
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <p></p>
    In week 5, we made a game with a program called Alice. We had to have movement and some sprites to interact with.
    <p></p>
    <h2>Week 6 - Week 8</h2>
    <p></p>
    In these weeks, We made our websites. starting out with out homepage and building on that foundation. <p></p>
    We then added stylesheets to that to further
    increase our customization for our website. <p></p>
    In week 8, we added a math game to show whether you were wrong or right
    and kept score to 10 points. You
    can see the website by clicking the various links.
    <p></p>
    <h2>Week 9 and 10</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img src="Portrait.PNG" height="300" width="500">
    <p></p>
    In this week, we made a self portrait using p5.js and calling it from an html file. <p></p>
    This was just simple shapes on the x and y. In week 10, we made our shapes move around and bounce accross the screen. <p></p>
    We even made them grow in size and such to show what we can do in p5.js.
    <p></p>
    <h2>Weeks 11, 12, and 13</h2>
    <p></p>
    <img src="Game_capture.gif">
    <p></p>
    Im this week, we made a game with moving pieces and added mouse clicks and keyboard interaction. <p></p>
    It even has an exit to show you finished the game. I have included a GIF of the work! <p></p>
    In week 12, we simply refined it and turned everything to functions in the draw instead of lines of code in the draw. <p></p>
    Doing this made it easier to determine if there was anything wrong, what exactly would it be. <p></p>
    In week 13, We made it crazier by adding colors and more objects to avoid and moving at different speeds.
